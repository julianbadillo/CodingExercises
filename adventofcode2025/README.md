# Advent of Code 2025 - Day 1

This small project contains two runners for Day 1 and a library with the core logic.

Files:
- `day1/part1.rb` – runner for part 1
- `day1/part2.rb` – runner for part 2
- `lib/day1.rb` – library containing `Day1.count_zeros_part1` and `Day1.count_zeros_part2`
- `test/test_day1.rb` – unit tests using Minitest

Run the scripts with input (example):

```bash
ruby day1/part1.rb < day1/input.txt
ruby day1/part2.rb < day1/input.txt
```

Run tests with:

```bash
bundle install
rake
```
